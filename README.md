# AI for Climate Action: Carbon Emission Prediction Model üåçü§ñ

## Project Overview
This project addresses **UN SDG 13: Climate Action** by developing a machine learning model to predict carbon emissions based on various economic, industrial, and demographic factors. The goal is to help policymakers and organizations make data-driven decisions for emission reduction strategies.

## Problem Statement
Climate change is one of the most pressing global challenges. Accurate prediction of carbon emissions is crucial for:
- Setting realistic emission reduction targets
- Identifying key factors contributing to emissions
- Developing effective climate policies
- Monitoring progress toward carbon neutrality

## SDG Connection: SDG 13 - Climate Action
- **Target 13.2**: Integrate climate change measures into national policies and strategies
- **Target 13.3**: Improve education and awareness on climate change mitigation

## Machine Learning Approach
- **Primary Method**: Supervised Learning (Regression)
- **Algorithm**: Random Forest Regression with comparison to Linear Regression and XGBoost
- **Features**: GDP, Population, Energy Consumption, Industrial Production, etc.
- **Target**: CO2 Emissions (metric tons per capita)

- **Fairness**: Ensures model doesn't discriminate against developing nations
- **Transparency**: Provides interpretable results for policy decisions

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.8+
- Pandas & NumPy for data manipulation
- Scikit-learn for machine learning
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization
- Jupyter Notebook for interactive development

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the notebook: `jupyter notebook carbon_emission_prediction.ipynb`
3. Or execute the script: `python carbon_emission_model.py`

## Future Enhancements
